This respository is meant to track the changes made to my undergraduate thesis.
The files included here are the .tex file used to compile to .pdf in the
repository, the Sage script used for the examples in the paper, and a folder
containing the .tex and .pdf files uses at the different talks I have given.

ABSTRACT:
  A stream cipher uses pseudorandom sequences to mimic the security of a one-time
  pad. This paper will investigate how bent functions can be used to generate
  $f$-filtered bent sequences with large 2-adic valuation.  Rearrangements of
  these sequences could be effective for filtering the states of feedback with
  carry shift registers (FCSRs) in stream ciphers. The non-linearity of
  $f$-filtered bent sequences could provide resistance for FCSR-based stream
  ciphers in register synthesis attacks. In this paper, we show that it is
  possible to compute the 2-adic valuation of a bent sequence generated by a
  Maiorana-McFarland class Boolean function.
