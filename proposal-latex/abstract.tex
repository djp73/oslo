\par Register synthesis algorithms can recover the 
state of a feedback with carry shift registers (FCSRs)
using only a small portion of the generated sequence.
This paper covers the background necessary to
understand these algorithms and implements using
Python scripts in SAGE. The background covered includes
$p$-adic integers, finite state machines, and other
properties of FCSRs.
