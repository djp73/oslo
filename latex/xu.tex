\section{Xu's Rational Approximation Algorithm}
\par In Andrew Klapper's book, he roughly describes Xu's rational approximation
algorithm for $\pi$-adic sequences in any ring $R$. A description of Xu's Algorithm
is presented here in the context of the ring $\zzzp$, where $p$ does not have to be prime.

\par The rational approximation problem is presented here: Given the eventually
periodic digit representation of $\frac{a}{b}\in\zzzp$, find $a$ and $b$.

\par If there are no constraints on $a$ and $b$, then the entire sequence must be known
to solve the problem. Specifically, a single algebraic feedback shift register can
not produce all $\frac{a}{b}\in\zzzp$.
