  A stream cipher uses pseudorandom sequences to mimic the security of a
  one-time pad. This paper will investigate how Bent functions can be used
  to generate Bent sequences with large 2-adic span for use in feedback with
  carry shift registers (FCSRs). The linear complexity of an FCSR, a
  commonly used device in stream ciphers, directly relates to the magnitude
  of the 2-adic span of the sequence generated. This affects the resistance
  of the stream cipher against register synthesis attacks. In this paper, it
  is shown that it is possible to compute the 2-adic value of a Bent
  sequence.
