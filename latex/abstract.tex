	A stream cipher makes use of pseudorandom sequences to create a
	nearly perfect one-time pad. The feedback with carry shift register (FCSR)
	is a finite state machine that generates pseudorandom sequences
	for us in stream ciphers. This paper will investigate how bent functions
	can be used to produce pseudorandom sequences that possess non-linearity
	properites which will resist register synthesis attacks.
	The paper also considers the 2-adic span of "bent sequences" which
	are related to the size of the FCSR necessary to produce the sequence.
