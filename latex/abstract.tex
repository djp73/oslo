  A stream cipher uses pseudorandom sequences to mimic the security of a
  one-time pad. This paper will investigate how bent functions can be used
  to generate lexicographical bent sequences with large 2-adic valuation.
	Rearrangements of these sequences could be effective for filtering the states
	of feedback with carry shift registers (FCSRs) in stream ciphers. The
	non-linearity of lexicographical bent sequences could provide resistance
  for FCSR-based stream ciphers in register synthesis attacks. In this paper, we
	show that it is possible to compute the 2-adic valuation of a bent
  sequence generated by a Maiorana-McFarland class Boolean function.
